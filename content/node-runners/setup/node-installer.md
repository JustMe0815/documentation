description: How to easily install a node on Windows
---


We’re on a mission to make running a Mysterium Node as effortless and enjoyable as possible. 

For every Windows user out there, we’ve just released a new installer which sets up your node in a matter of minutes. You can check out these steps below. 

## What does the installer actually do?

It checks that your computer meets the requirements for running a node.
If it does, it will install and launch the software, including Docker for Desktop and the Mysterium Node image.
It will configure the autorun of Docker Desktop and container (required for Docker Desktop to start).
It checks for new Node upgrades, and enables the software to upgrade automatically.
It allows you to enable or disable the Mysterium Node container.


## What new features & functionalities does this introduce? 

You no longer need to install or start Docker Desktop manually.
You don’t need to configure or upgrade your Node container manually.
You can enable/disable Node service in-app.
You can open Node UI in-app.


## There are only 3 steps to get you started:
 

1. Enable Virtualization Extensions in the BIOS and in Virtual Machine (if one is used): VT-x / EPT / IOMMU or SVM for AMD-based systems.

2. Download and open myst-launcher-amd64.exe (or myst-launcher-testnet3-amd64.exe for the Pre-Mainnet version). *Please note that a system restart might be required by the Windows Node Installer.

3. Finish the installation process and complete your onboarding by opening Node UI page and claiming your node. *Please note that still you need to log into your desktop session (required for Docker Desktop to start).
