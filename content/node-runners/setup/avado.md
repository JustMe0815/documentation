[AVADO](https://ava.do/earn-crypto) is your plug & play solution giving you access to the WEB3 by running a Blockchain Node. Until today it was mainly a tool for developers to access a blockchain or for users that value privacy and want to have control over who can track their transactions.

Your [AVADO Box](https://ava.do/earn-crypto) is top-notch hardware and has a powerful CPU, huge RAM, ample Disk space, Internet access, and more. All these features of your Box allow you to earn cryptocurrency. We call utilizing these features, "Smart Mining"!

**You can rent out your processing power, or your storage, or even your bandwidth.**

By selecting the Mysterium Network package from the AVADO DAppstore, you can rent out your bandwidth and earn up to 130 MYST every month. Mysterium Network has created a VPN for private internet access, and it is all peer to peer. Why use a VPN? Simply because information should be available to anyone and Firewalls, geo-blocks and censorship erode democracy and freedom of expression. 

*"You help the internet to be great again and deserve the name World Wide Web."

By opening your AVADO Box as a secure VPN connection, people in certain countries that buy VPN services from Mysterium Network can gain access to Wikipedia, as an example. 

You help the internet to be great again and deserve the name World Wide Web. Moreover, all you need is a stable connection and Mysterium Networkâ€™s easy to use app, so you can be in sleep mode while your AVADO works for you.

**I want to earn crypto, what do I need to do?**

First of all, you need an [AVADO Box](https://ava.do/earn-crypto) because we ensured that the **Mysterium Network** package runs frictionless on this hardware.

You can find the Mysterium Package in your AvadOS DAppstore.
