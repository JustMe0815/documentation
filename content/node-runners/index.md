description: Our mission as Mysterium Node runners
---

The fabric of an interconnected, open and democratic internet is tearing apart in the hands of corporations and governments. We are reinventing the web so that it becomes safe, accessible and private by default. As a grassroots and community-driven project, you are quite literally what powers our network.

## How does it work?
When you become a node you share your IP address (anonymously) and spare bandwidth to help power our dVPN. It helps users bypass censorship and surveillance, and protects them against cybercrime. You’re also welcome to use <a href="https://mysterium.network/apps/">Mysterium dVPN</a> anytime you like.

## What do I get out of it?
The best digital karma and a whole lot of respect and kudos! Also - if you’re eligible for our bounty, you get cryptocurrency every month.

Once our P2P network is live, you’ll be able to rent your bandwidth to a global user base and set your price based on supply and demand.
