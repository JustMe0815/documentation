## What is Mysterium Network 
Mysterium Network is building a global decentralised network of residential IPs.

The fabric of an interconnected, open and democratic internet is tearing apart in the hands of corporations and governments. We are reinventing the web so that it becomes safe, accessible and private by default. As a grassroots and community-driven project, you are quite literally what powers our network.

## How does it work?
When you run a Mysterium Node you share your IP address (anonymously) and spare bandwidth to help power our dVPN. It helps users bypass censorship and surveillance, and protects them against cybercrime. Youâ€™re also welcome to use <a href="https://mysterium.network/apps/">Mysterium dVPN</a> anytime you like.

## Like TOR but incentivised
Mysterium Network is building a peer to peer network. In this network, Mysterium Nodes earn for providing VPN service to global users. 
Mysterium Network has been running an incentivised test network from early 2019. Check out our <a href="https://my.mysterium.network/network">network statistics</a>. 

We are also hard at work progressing micropayments within our network. Follow our journey into <a href="https://mysterium.network/blog/">blockchain based payments</a>.
