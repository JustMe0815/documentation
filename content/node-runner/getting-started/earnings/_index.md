The concept behind Mysterium's earning system is fairly straightforward.

### Pre-mainnet bounty system

Before we move into Mainnet, we're incentivizing node running through our Bounty Pilot. The idea of
 decentralized VPN network is that people running the VPN service are paid by people using VPN service, however
  getting there isn't a short and easy journey. In order to build the network, we need active testers who are willing to
   participate in the Bounty Pilot and get paid up to $50 worth of ETH for running a VPN service. This money is
    subsidised
    by Mysterium Network, therefore there are limits to what you can earn. Our software is still young and we're
     working hard and fast to deliver the worlds' first decentralized VPN network. Running a VPN service has it's
      technical challenges and things might break from time to time. For this reason (and a few other reasons) we're
       subsidising node runners from our own funds to ensure that we're getting as much feedback as possible to
        prepare us
        for going to Mainnet. We need your help to make sure that at the end of 2020 Q3 we have a tested and fully
         working
       node software infrastructure.
    
### Mainnet payments

Once we move to Mainnet, there will be no limits to what you can earn. Your earnings will be based upon the
 consumption of your services, your nodes will be earning MYST (ERC-20) tokens and you'll be able to set your own
  price for the services. We will provide guidelines to ensure you're up to date with the market and be able to
   compete with other nodes.
