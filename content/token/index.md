description: Everything you need to know about earning MYST tokens or ETH from node runner bounties.

The concept behind Mysterium's earning system is fairly straightforward.

### Pre-mainnet bounty system

Before we move into Mainnet, we're incentivizing node running through our Bounty Pilot.
The idea of decentralized VPN network is that people running the VPN service are paid by people using VPN service, however getting there isn't a short and easy journey.
In order to build the network, we need active testers who are willing to
participate in the Bounty Pilot and get paid up to $50 worth of ETH for running a VPN service. This money is subsidised
by Mysterium Network, therefore there are limits to what you can earn.
Our software is still young and we're working hard and fast to deliver the worlds' first decentralized VPN network.
Running a VPN service has its technical challenges and things might break from time to time.
For this reason (and a few other reasons) we're subsidising node runners from our own funds to ensure that we're getting as much feedback as possible to prepare us
for going to Mainnet.
We need your help to make sure that at the end of 2020 Q3 we have a tested and fully working node software infrastructure.
    
### Mainnet payments

Once we move to Mainnet, there will be no limits to what you can earn.
Your earnings will be based upon the consumption of your services, your nodes will be earning MYST (ERC-20) tokens and you'll be able to set your own price for the services.
We will provide guidelines to ensure you're up to date with the market and be able to compete with other nodes.

Mysterium (**MYST**) is a cryptocurrency **token** deployed as smart contract which operates on the Ethereum blockchain and allows users to perform activities within the Mysterium VPN network both as VPN clients or as a service provider (VPN Node).

MYST is an integral part of Mysterium Network where VPN consumers is charged fees for services. The biggest slice of those fees goes to the VPN node owner (service provider) the leftover will be dedicated to protocol development and support. As aforementioned node owners who run their nodes are incentivized for their support of the network. In such a way node owner essentially acts as a miner, with reward coming in MYST token form. Differently from the typical blockchains the miner is  rewarded not for his computing power (proof of work), ownership of the currency (proof of stake), but for sharing their bandwidth.The token reflects growth of Mysterium Network. Mysterium Foundation will pursuit the possibility to enable MYST holders benefit by receiving a commission for each transaction in the Mysterium Network with payments being conducted in currencies other than MYST.

#### Current pricing

The current pricing for network consumers is:

- 1 gigabyte of traffic: **0.2 MYST**
- 1 minute of session: **0.00001 MYST**
- Accountant fee: **12%**

One gigabyte will earn you *0.10* MYST. You will earn **0.0001** MYST / minute of each session your node accepts.
Mysterium node runners are able to fine-tune and set their own pricing.
