## Mysterium Node Bounty Programs

Mysterium‚Äôs bounty programs reward those who run a node and help power the network during our testnet (BETA) development. 

Once we launch on ‚ú®mainnet‚ú®, the bounty program will change. This is because the network will become a purely peer-to-peer system, where VPN users will pay nodes directly. Payments will be based on a supply and demand algorithm.

Until then, we have two different bounties depending on where you are based:

 1. Regional Bounty (residential IP only)
 2. Global Bounty (Any IP)

All nodes can earn based on the ‚Äútime x bandwidth‚Äù model, meaning the amount of data transmitted through your node and the amount of time users are connected for. The more users who connect to your node, the more you will earn. 

Important Definitions:

**MYSTT** - Test tokens used to calculate the usage of your node. 1 MYSTT = 1
MYST. [See how much MYST costs today](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mysterium).

**Residential IP** - An IP address tied to a physical device, in our case Raspberry
Pis [preferred for Mysterium Network and a higher likelihood of earning], desktops or mobile phones.

### Residential IP bounties with payout caps and rolling payments

Our first node pilot bounty rule will only apply to **residential IPs in the following regions:**

-Australia
-Brasil
-Canada
-Colombia
-Croatia
-Germany
-Hong Kong
-Ireland
-Italy
-India
-Japan
-Kenya
-Malaysia
-Mexico
-Netherlands
-New Zealand
-Nigeria
-Portugal
-South Korea
-South Africa
-United Kingdom
-United States

All nodes must be linked to a residential IP address, meaning no data center IPs will be rewarded. For these non-residential IPs, you can check out our second bounty program.

There is no cap on the number of nodes that can earn rewards, however, you will still need to run a stable node and earn more than the minimum payout of 5 MYST. Each node can earn up to 80 MYST. 

If you do not earn enough MYSTT to qualify for earnings in the first month, your accumulated MYSTT will be transferred to the next month. This also means you will stand a higher chance of earning in the following month. Once you are paid, your MYSTT total will return to zero and the process starts again. Payouts are made at the beginning of each month.

### Scenarios

**For example** - _John downloads Mysterium‚Äôs node software on his computer in the UK and begins running his node. John starts to earn MYSTT as users connect to his node. ._

_Scenario A: At the end of his first month, John earns a total of 20 MYSTT. If John is among the top performing nodes [calculated by the total amount of MYSTT earned], he will be eligible for a bounty reward. He will be paid 20 MYST and restart month two with a zero balance._

_Scenario B: At the end of his first month, John earns a total of 4 MYSTT. If he is not among the top performing nodes, so his 4 MYSTT will roll over to the second month. If John earns another 40 MYSTT in month two, this brings his accumulated total to 44 MYSTT. If John is eligible to receieve a payout based on his total earnings, he will be paid 44 MYST in month two. Once he collects his payout, his MYSTT balance will return to zero starting in month two._

_Scenario C: At the end of his first month, John earns a total of 100 MYSTT. If he is among the top performing nodes, he will be paid 80 MYST (the maximum, capped amount). Once he collects his payout, his MYSTT balance will return to zero starting in month two._


With our residential IP bounty, we may need to add more regions or change limits. Changes are based on the needs of our users. We will provide you with one week‚Äôs notice in the case of upcoming changes.

### Global bounty

[If you qualify for the regional bounty, you can stop reading here because the global bounty is applied automatically and won't affect your regional earnings]

Our second bounty program is open to every country in the world. Nodes can also offer any type of IP address [residential IP or data-centre IP]. To be eligible you must have an identifiable IP address and verification of your geolocation checked against [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home).

For this bounty, the top 5 performing nodes per country worldwide will earn MYSTT. Any node runner in any country can participate. Monthly earnings are capped at 20 MYST per node. If you are already participating in our "Residential IP bounties", you are welcome to participate in this second bounty and earn an extra 20 MYST.

In this bounty program, the five nodes with the highest number of MYSTT will earn for the month. If you earn MYSTT but do not qualify as one of the top five, do not fear - you will still be able to keep your MYSTT and continue to accumulate earnings for the following month. This puts you in a better position to become a top 5 node for your region in the upcoming months.

### Scenarios

**For example** - _Jane begins running a node in Turkey. In her first month she earns 10 MYSTT. This does not place her within the top 5 nodes within her region. She continues to run her node in month two. During this period she earns another 30 MYSTT. The total number is now 40 MYSTT at the end of month two, making Jane one of the top five nodes in Turkey. This makes her eligible for a 20 MYST bounty payout. Once she receives her bounty reward, her MYSTT balance will fall to zero._

**If you abuse the Mysterium Node Pilot bounty rules, you will not be paid.**

We are extremely conscious of building a resilient and robust network. This means keeping an eye out for bad actors. We
see the following criteria as abuse:

1. Multiple nodes running on the same subnet
2. Artificially producing large amounts of traffic/sessions for your node. Traffic should be natural, produced by 3rd
   parties, Mysterium Network‚Äôs super proxy or test agent.

This list of abuse criteria will grow - we know hackers out there will continue to game the system. We‚Äôre a hacktivist
team, so we expect it, but don‚Äôt expect to get paid ü§£ü§£ü§£
