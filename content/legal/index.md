Read the [Exit node](https://dvpnalliance.org/exit-node/) guide.

### Can providers see my traffic?

Mysterium node encrypts traffic that is routed through a node therefore no traffic is visible on the provider side.

### Can providers see my IP address?

Providers are able to see your IP address within the node logs without any associated traffic information.

### Can users see my IP address?

When users connect to your node, your IP address becomes theirs, giving them a broader access to online services available at your geographical location.

If you have any questions please check our FAQ section or send us an e-mail (help@mysterium.network) and we will make sure to get back to you with an answer.
