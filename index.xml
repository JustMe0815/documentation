      <description>Getting started with a Raspberry Pi The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, mini-computer used by our node runners to help power Mysterium Network. It provides a stable, 24/7 network connection, and most importantly, it enables you to earn with minimal effort on your part. While there are other options for running a node, with an RPI you no longer need to worry about closing your laptop lid or keeping your PC on.</description>

      <description>Start your node with the following command (custom port=25007 is used for the example below):¬†docker run --cap-add NET_ADMIN -p 127.0.0.1:4449:4449 -p 25007:25007/udp \¬†--rm --name myst \¬†-v $YOUR_MYSTERIUM_DIR:/var/lib/mysterium-node \¬†mysteriumnetwork/myst \¬†--experiment-natpunching=false \¬†service \¬†--agreed-terms-and-conditions \¬†--openvpn.port=25007 Replace $YOUR_MYSTERIUM_DIR with the path where you&amp;rsquo;d like to store the node&amp;rsquo;s configuration and keystore files, e.g.
export YOUR_MYSTERIUM_DIR=~/.mysterium  Turn off NAT Traversal (port hole punching):¬†&amp;ndash;experiment-natpunching=false Map Docker container ports manually: container port 25007 to [YOUR_LOCAL_NETWORK_IP]:25007 Once that is done, switch to your router and map the necessary custom port from router to your local machine: [YOUR_PUBLIC_IP]:25007 to -&amp;gt; [YOUR_LOCAL_NETWORK_IP]:25007.</description>

      <description>Mysterium (MYST) is a cryptocurrency token deployed as smart contract which operates on the Ethereum blockchain and allows users to perform activities within the Mysterium VPN network both as VPN clients or¬†as a service provider¬†(VPN Node).
MYST is an integral part of Mysterium Network where VPN consumers is charged fees for services. The biggest slice of those fees goes to the VPN node owner (service provider) the leftover will be dedicated to protocol development and support.</description>

      <description>Docker Desktop for Windows is Docker designed to run on Windows 10. It is a native Windows application that provides an easy-to-use development environment for building, shipping, and running dockerized apps. Docker Desktop for Windows uses Windows-native Hyper-V virtualization and networking and is the fastest and most reliable way to develop Docker apps on Windows.¬†System Requirements  Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later).

      <description>In logs I see client&amp;rsquo;s attempts, but it does not fully connect There might be many things, but most frequent is firewall. If You run node via docker image, check that¬†ip_forwarding¬†is enabled on a host and that UDP service port (specified by¬†--openvpn.port¬†flag) is allowed from outside.
check ip_forward status:
# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward enable ip_forward if disabled:
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 It also might be that default firewall forward policy is set to¬†DROP.</description>

      <title>NAT traversal</title>

      <guid>https://docs.mysterium.network/node-runner/troubleshooting/network/nat-traversal/</guid>
      <description>NAT Traversal also known as UDP encapsulation allows traffic to get to the specified destination when a device does not have a public IP address. This is usually the case if your ISP is doing NAT, or the external interface of your firewall is connected to a device that has NAT enabled.
The shortage of IPv4 addresses and the very slow transition to IPv6 leads to pragmatic solutions in the Internet: today many hosts are still using IPv4 and are connected to the Internet over a Network Address Translation (NAT) router.</description>

      <description>If You use docker image, it is strongly recommended not to store identity inside docker container (since You might need to remove container in order to upgrade), but to mount Your keystore from Your host to container using -v host_volume:container_volume option as follows:
# docker run --cap-add NET_ADMIN --net host -v /home/mysterium-node:/var/lib/mysterium-node --name myst -d mysteriumnetwork/myst service --identity.passphrase=your_passphrase_here Now You can copy and safely store /home/mysterium-node/keystore directory to backup all Your identities.</description>

      <description>Backing up your Raspberry Pi node ID For this we shall be using Putty and Windows Powershell (Terminal in Linux/MacOS).
So open up Putty and SSH into your RPI using the following command:
Now to copy the keystore folder to your home directory.¬†$ sudo cp -r /var/lib/mysterium-node/keystore /home/pi Make sure that it is properly copied.
sudo ls -la /home/pi Change the ownership of the folder and files.
$ sudo chown -R pi keystore Now you will have a keystore folder on your home directory and you are finished with</description>

      <description>I am getting &amp;ldquo;403 Forbidden&amp;rdquo; error If you see the message &amp;ldquo;identity is not registered&amp;rdquo; for the 403 error, that means that you are trying to connect with an unregistered identity.
You need to finish registration process for your identity to be accepted.
This error might also mean that you are connecting to discovery service which is closed for Your IP, either because someone from your IP was abusing the service or due to load issues.</description>

      <description>NAT (Network Address Translation) is used to enable internet access for computers that do not have an external internet address (IP). Usually of the form like 192.168.x.y or 10.x.y.z If you are running a node on a computer behind NAT you will need some means to enable access to your node from outside your local network. Below are suggested methods to enable such external access.
Essentially you need to make ports on which node services run accessible from outside.</description>

      <description>What is a Mysterium Node? Mysterium Node is a piece of software which represents Mysterium Network&amp;rsquo;s element responsible for either providing or consuming a network service. Such node can be run on your Raspberry PI, Docker or any Debian based distribution. The current mobile version does not support service running.
Mysterium node runner/provider A node that&amp;rsquo;s providing a service within Mysterium Network is called a Provider. Our node software can operate as a Provider or as a Consumer, but in this section lets focus on the provider side of things.</description>
